Project Name:
MochaViperIDE 

Created by Jonathan Ke, 12/4/2019

Description:
Custom code editor that can parse and translate Java
source code into Python source code compatible with 
Python 3. Includes a visualization tool that creates
parse trees from source code and a minigame that allows
the user to explore the visualization tool.

Running MochaViperIDE:
Open and run MochaViperIDE.py in Python 3 to run application.
Load files and projects that you would like to open in 
the MochaViperIDE environment by placing them inside the 
"Projects" folder in this application folder. 

*Please do not touch any of the other files in this application
 as this may prevent the application from functioning properly.

Special Shortcuts:
To get the answers to each of the 3 levels in the minigame, use the
load feature in the window to load in "Level1.java", "Level2.java",
and "Level3.java" into the Java text editor, respectively. After 
loading in each level, click "Match Code to Level" to verify and 
pass the level.
